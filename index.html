                    <p>Most other companies don't understand the use of equalizers. They don't recognise that everyone is different, and they especially don't realize that those differences are important. At equalizer, we value our customers for their differences. Thus, we provide every one of our listeners with a powerful, easy-to-use equalizer.</p>

                    <p>The Equalizer rating system has many parts, all working together to give you the best listening experience. When you rate a song or artist, our algorithm takes notice, works some patented analytical magic, and gives you personalized recommendations. That means listening to more of what you love, and none of what you hate.</p>

Look forward to an in-app messaging system and the possibility for artists to reach out to their Superfans directly. Artists will also be able to promote shows and new music on their artist's page.</p>
