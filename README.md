# landing_page_DGoldelman

Hello! Welcome to the landing page for my Software Engineering project! 

All code was written from scratch. You can find the following required code samples on the related lines:

index.html:
  div: line 11
  hyperlink: line 22
  img: line 20
  navigation bar: line 11
  iframe: line 118
  
style.css:
  style via id attributes: line 204
  style via class attributes: line 23
  
Please Note: 

There is no second HTML file because it was allowed to just put an external iframe into the one HTML file, replacing the need for a second file.
